# twitter-airflow-data-engineering-Project
# Overview

This project implements a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract data from the Twitter API, process it using pandas, and load it into an AWS S3 bucket in CSV format.

Requirements

Python 3
Apache Airflow
AWS S3
Twitter developer account
Setup

Install Python 3 and Apache Airflow.
Create an AWS S3 bucket to store the data pipeline output.
Create a Twitter developer account and obtain your API keys.
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
Create a .env file and add your Twitter API keys and AWS S3 bucket name to it.
Install the project dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the pipeline

To run the pipeline, execute the following command:

airflow run twitter_data_pipeline
This will start the Airflow DAG, which will extract the data from Twitter, process it, and load it into the S3 bucket.

Monitoring the pipeline

You can monitor the progress of the pipeline in the Airflow UI. To access the Airflow UI, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Conclusion

This project provides a simple example of how to use Apache Airflow to build a data pipeline. You can customize the pipeline to meet your specific needs, such as extracting different data from Twitter, processing it in different ways, or loading it into a different data store.
